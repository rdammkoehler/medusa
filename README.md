### Medusa

A simulator of Scrum Team project executions
work in progress, please don't judge me just yet.

## Description

Using some kind of data file input, emulate the execution of a team over time. 
Simulate things like defect rate, defect resolution, objectives met.
Simulate real situations like adding and removing team members, vacation, sick time, etc.
Simulate changes in business direction.
Simulate team members with diminished capacity due to time-slicing.
Provide a controllable degree of randomization of events

Generate/collect all metrics
Plot (or provide in plotable forms) data about the teams performance, budget burn, etc.
Track relationship of defects to cost, value delivery impact, etc.
Run side-by-side emulations where the team goes slow and doesn't make defects v. where they do
Make clear impact of changes v. defects

Other ideas?


## Data file layout

What would the data file kinda' look like?
